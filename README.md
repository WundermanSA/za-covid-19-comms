# COVID-19 .co.za communication

On the 26th March 2020, the South African government posted a [gazette](http://www.gpwonline.co.za/Gazettes/Gazettes/43164_26-3_Telecommunications.pdf), stating that all Internet sites operating with a South African top level domain are required to have a "landing page" with a visible link to https://sacoronavirus.co.za/

`5.1.4 Internet sites operating within .zaDNA top level domain name must have a landing page with a visible link to www.sacoronavirus.co.za.`

Unfortunately, the information provided isn't too specific around implementation details. 

This script provides a quick and simple way for South African website owners to take quick action without worrying about implementation details - Something visible, but not too intrusive.
